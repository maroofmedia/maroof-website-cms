**Hello,  
Glad you’re here!**

This is the very first post on this website. I’ve been thinking about doing this for a long time—grabbing a domain with my name and making a space online that’s just mine. Like, something personal where I can share stuff I care about or things I learn along the way.

So last week, I finally sat down in front of my PC (with chai by my side, obviously) and bought a domain with my name. Felt kinda cool, honestly. Then I made a super basic structure for the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nothing fancy, but it worked. And then I hosted it on Cloudflare Pages because… well, why not? It’s free and easy.

Now came the tricky part: adding blog functionality. At first, I thought, “Yo, WordPress!” because I’ve used WP so many times before, and I have plenty of space on my hosting plan. But then I realized, nah, WordPress might be overkill for what I want to do here. This isn’t gonna be some huge blog empire—it’s more like a chill corner of the internet.

I did some Googling (as one does), and that’s when I stumbled upon *static site generators*. Ever heard of them? Basically, instead of having a database running everything (like WordPress does), static sites generate plain HTML files from your content. Sounds boring, right? But trust me, it’s awesome because it makes your site faster and simpler to manage.

After looking around, I decided to go with **Eleventy** (or 11ty). If you don’t know what Eleventy is, let me break it down for ya: it’s a simple static site generator that lets you write posts in Markdown (which is way easier than writing full-blown HTML every time). No databases, no complicated setups—just clean, straightforward code. Plus, it works perfectly with the design I already had going.

So yeah, I reworked my initial codebase to integrate Eleventy into my static site. Took some trial and error (and lots of coffee), but now we’re live! 🎉

In future posts, I’ll probably talk about random stuff—things I’m learning, projects I’m working on, maybe even some life updates from Kashmir. Who knows? The goal is to share whatever I think could be useful or interesting to you guys.

Thanks for stopping by, though. Means a lot. Catch you in the next post!
