# My First Post: A New Beginning

## Hello, Glad You Are Here!

This is the very first post on my website, and I’m excited to finally get this started. For a long time, I wanted to have a website with my own domain name, but like many things, I kept putting it off. 

Last week, I finally sat down, purchased a domain, and built a simple website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hosted it on Cloudflare Pages, and with that, the foundation was set. But a website without a blog felt incomplete. 

At first, I thought of using WordPress (WP) on a subdirectory or subdomain. Since I have worked with WP for years and even have ample space on my hosting, it seemed like an obvious choice. But for a personal blog like this, WP felt too heavy and complex. I wanted something lightweight and simple.

That’s when I started exploring **static site generators (SSGs)**. After some research, I came across **Eleventy (11ty)**, and it seemed like the perfect fit. 

## What is Eleventy?

Eleventy is a simple and flexible static site generator. Unlike WordPress, it doesn’t require a database, making the website faster and easier to manage. It lets me write content in **Markdown**, which is a straightforward way to format text without dealing with complex editors. Eleventy is also highly customizable, giving me full control over the design and structure of my blog. 

Once I chose Eleventy, I modified my website to integrate it. It took some effort, but now my blog is fully functional and running smoothly!

## What’s Next?

Now that my blog is live, I plan to share my thoughts, experiences, and whatever I learn along the way. Whether it's about web development, OSINT, fact-checking, cybersecurity, or just random musings—this space is for all of it. 

If you’re reading this, thanks for stopping by! This is just the beginning of something exciting. Let’s see where this journey takes us.
