  <p><em>This article first appeared in the annual school magazine, <strong>Zaingeer</strong>, of <strong>Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Bomai Sopore</strong>, for the 2023-2024 academic year under my name. Below, I have reproduced it with slight edits along with some images.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Picture a place where history meets hope, and the stories of the past live on in the present. In the beautiful landscapes of Kashmir, we find two special places – <strong>Zaingeer</strong> and <strong>Bomai</strong>. These aren’t just names; they carry memories, traditions, and a strong sense of community. Zaingeer, a group of villages, and Bomai, one of its own, reflect a shared history and unity that has lasted for generations. This article takes you through their rich heritage and the close bonds that make these places truly special.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Zaingeer: A Land of History and Progress.</h2>
<p>Around 40 km from Srinagar lies <strong>Sopore</strong>, a place known by many names—<em>Chota London</em> and the <em>Apple Town of Kashmir</em>. Sopore is well-known for its rich culture, thriving markets, and apple orchards. Among its many areas, one belt stands out: <strong>Zaingeer</strong>. This region holds deep historical importance, with roots going back to the 15th century during the rule of Sultan Zainul Abidin, fondly remembered as &quot;Budshah.&quot;</p>
<p>Sultan Zainul Abidin was known for his kindness and vision. He worked to improve the lives of the people, promoted art and culture, and supported agriculture. His efforts left a lasting impact on Zaingeer, shaping its identity even today.</p>
<p>Among his many legacies, Sultan Zainul Abidin commissioned the <strong>Zaingair Canal</strong>. This canal, originating as a sublet of Nallah Madhumatti at Sonawari in Bandipora district, serves as the most important source of irrigation in the entire Zaingeer belt. Further sublets of the Zainageer canal start from Botengu village and spread across the entire region.</p>
<p>The author of <em>Tabakat-i-Akbari</em> said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No monarch of Kashmir had worked towards constructing the nation, fostering agriculture, and digging canals as much as Budshah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Zaingair</strong>, a group of over 38 villages, forms the largest area within Sopore. Villages like Wadoora, Warpora, Goripora, Hathlangoo, Saidpora, Dooru, Darpora, Botingoo, Bomai, Tujar, Brath, Dangerpora, and Zaloora each bring their own unique character and contribute to the region’s culture and daily life. The name &quot;Zaingair&quot; itself honors Sultan Zainul Abidin, who played a key role in shaping this area, which stretches from Kupwara's Sagipora to Baramulla's Watlab.</p>
<p>Besides running businesses and working in government and private jobs, the people of Zaingeer mainly rely on apple orchards, which are not just a way to earn a living but also show their hard work and determination. Over time, educational institutions like the <strong>Agriculture University in Wadoora Sopore</strong> have been set up, helping to educate the youth who will lead the region in the future. While appreciating Zaingeer's rich history, it’s important to remember those who contributed to its growth, especially Sultan Zainul Abidin, whose efforts still leave a mark today.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Bomai: The Village I Live In</h2>
<p>Within the Zaingeer belt lies <strong>Bomai</strong>, which is the second-largest village in Zaingeer after Dangerpora. The name of the village, Bomai, has interesting origins. One theory suggests that a kind-hearted Kashmiri Pandit woman named 'Boomaishhveri' used to help people from all over Kashmir. When folks planned to visit her, they'd say <em>&quot;me che gasun boomeshveri nish&quot;</em> (I have to go to visit Bomeshveri), which later became <em>&quot;me che gsun Bomai,&quot;</em> just like <em>&quot;Suyyapur to Sopore.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Another theory is that since Chinar is called &quot;Booen&quot; in the Kashmiri language and Bomai has a lot of Chinars around it, the name might have evolved from &quot;Boen to Bomai.&quot; It's worth noting that hundreds of these iconic Chinar trees grace the landscape of Bomai, even housing a vibrant Chinar market. Regardless of the tales, Bomai stands as a testament to unity and growth.</p>
<p>Bomai, often known as a single village, is in fact a trio combination of three villages - <strong>Edipora, Bomai, and Malpora Panditan</strong>. Surrounded by areas like Tujar, Shiva, and Seeloo on the front, Bomai plays a significant role in Kashmir's economy, especially in the apple trade. Beyond business, it boasts a hospital, Tehsil office, forest department office, and even an educational hub.</p>
<p>Education flourishes in Bomai, with institutions like <strong>Eagle English Medium Public High School Bomai</strong>, <strong>Government Boys Higher Secondary School Bomai</strong>, and <strong>Government Girls School Bomai</strong>. The star on Bomai's educational horizon is the upcoming <strong>Government Degree College</strong>, which is taking shape at Yambran Bomai, a short distance from main chowk Bomai, a promise of growth and learning for the region. While the permanent structure of Government Degree College Bomai takes shape at Yambran Bomai, the college temporarily resides within the premises of Government Boys Higher Secondary Bomai.</p>
<p>

        <figcaption>Site where the Government Degree College Bomai now stands. Photo: Aijaz Rasool/Facebook</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </p>
<p>Bomai’s true strength lies not just in its progress but in the deep bonds that connect its people. Though time and distance may have separated some from their roots, the spirit of the village remains alive. The story of the Kashmiri Pandits who once lived here is a reminder of these enduring ties. Many still return to visit their ancestral homes, offering prayers and reconnecting with their heritage.</p>
<p>This sense of unity was especially evident in 2014, when the village <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/sunanda-s-village-mourns-her-death/story-UhLParACK5zmuquNJl9DWM.html">mourned</a> the passing of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunanda_Pushkar">Sunanda Pushkar</a></strong>, a prominent Kashmiri Pandit businesswoman born in Bomai and the wife of renowned politician and writer Shashi Tharoor. The heartfelt response from the community reflected Bomai’s true spirit—a place where old bonds are honored, and every return is met with warmth and respect, symbolizing harmony and togetherness.</p>

<h2>Ancient and Historical Rock in Bomai</h2>
<h3>Ancient Rock Carving in Bomai May Show Meteor Event from Thousands of Years Ago</h3>
<p>A team of researchers has found an ancient rock in Bomai that seems to show a meteor event from thousands of years ago. The carving on the rock has several concentric circles, which the researchers believe represent the impact of a meteor shower.</p>
<p>The rock is located about 3 kilometers northwest of the main chowk in Bomai. The engraved part of the rock measures around 1 by 1 meter, with its top-left side pointing toward the northwest.</p>
<p>The researchers think the carving was made by people who lived in the area at that time and may have witnessed the event. They believe the carving was their way of recording what they saw, leaving behind a memory of that moment for future generations.</p>
<p>

      </figure>
    </p>
<h3>A Link Between the Carving and Kashmir’s Lakes?</h3>
<p>What makes this discovery even more interesting is the possible connection to four major lakes in the region—<strong>Wular Lake</strong>, <strong>Manasbal Lake</strong>, <strong>Dal Lake</strong>, and <strong>Anchar Lake</strong>. The researchers believe the circles in the carving could represent the impacts from the meteor shower that might have led to the formation of these lakes.</p>
<p>Three of the circles on the rock are lined up in a straight direction, matching the way Wular, Manasbal, and Dal Lakes are positioned on the map. The largest circle could represent Wular Lake, which is the biggest freshwater lake in Asia, followed by Manasbal and Dal Lakes. The fourth circle could represent Anchar Lake. A smaller circle between two larger ones might match the smaller water bodies found between the lakes today.</p>
<p>The rock’s direction hints that the meteor may have come from the northwest and traveled toward the southeast, which fits the alignment of the lakes in the same direction.</p>
<p>The researchers are continuing to study the rock carving and the lakes in the area. They hope to learn more about the meteor event that occurred and its impact on the region.</p>
