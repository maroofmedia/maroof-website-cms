# Hello, Glad You’re Here!

Welcome to the very first post on my website! I’m genuinely excited to kick things off and finally bring this idea to life. For a long time, I had planned of having a website with my own domain name—but like most plans, I kept putting it off.

## The Journey Begins 🚀

Last week, I finally decided to stop procrastinating. I bought a domain, built a simple website using basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and hosted it on **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)**. Just like that, the foundation was set.

But something was missing…\
A website without a blog felt incomplete.

## Why Not WordPress?

At first, I considered using **[WordPress (WP)](https://wordpress.org/)** for my blog, either on a subdirectory or a subdomain. 

> *What’s WordPress?*\
> WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that powers millions of websites. It allows users to create, manage, and publish content with ease using plugins, themes, and a user-friendly interface.

Since I’ve worked with WordPress for years and had plenty of hosting space available, it seemed like the obvious choice. But for a personal blog like this, WordPress felt a bit too heavy and overly complex. I wanted something **lightweight** and **simple**.

## Discovering Static Site Generators (SSGs)

That’s when I started exploring **Static Site Generators (SSGs)**.

> *What’s an SSG?*\
> An SSG converts plain text content into static HTML files during the build process. Unlike traditional CMS platforms like WordPress, SSGs don’t need a database, making websites faster, more secure, and easier to manage.

After some research, I found **[Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/)**—and it seemed like the perfect fit.

### What’s Eleventy?

**Eleventy** is a flexible and beginner-friendly static site generator. Unlike WordPress, it doesn’t rely on a database, which keeps the site fast and lightweight. It also lets me write content using **Markdown**, a simple way to format text without the hassle of complex editors.

What I love most about Eleventy is its customizability—it gives me complete control over the design and structure of my blog.

## Building the Blog 🛠️

Once I settled on Eleventy, I got to work integrating it into my website. It took a bit of effort (and lots of learning), but now the blog is fully functional and running smoothly.

## What’s Next?

Now that my blog is live, I plan to share:

* 💻 **Web Development Tips**  
* 🔍 **OSINT Techniques**  
* ✅ **Fact-Checking Insights**  
* 🌐 **Thoughts on Social Media & Internet Culture**  
* 📝 **Random musings**  

This space will be my little corner of the internet—where I share ideas, learn new things, and hopefully connect with readers like you.

If you’re reading this, **thank you** for stopping by! This is just the beginning of what I hope will be an exciting journey.

Let’s see where it takes us. 🚀
